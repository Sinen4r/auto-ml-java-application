## Features

- **Data Import**: Upload datasets through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Automated Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and clean the dataset.
- **Prediction**: Use machine learning models to predict outcomes based on the processed data.
- **Report Generation**: Generate insightful reports and visualizations of the results.
- **Java Backend**: Efficient processing and predictions using a robust Java-based engine.

## How It Works

1. **User Uploads Data**: The user uploads their dataset through the web interface.  
2. **Preprocessing**: The application automatically cleans and preprocesses the data.  
3. **Prediction**: A tailored prediction model is applied to the dataset.  
4. **Reporting**: Results are displayed on the interface and can be downloaded as a report.
